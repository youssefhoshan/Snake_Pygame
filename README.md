# My Pygame Snake Game

This is my implementation of a Snake game using Pygame. I followed a tutorial to learn the basics of Pygame and built my own game based on the tutorial.

## Installation

1. Install Python by downloading it from the official website.
2. Install Pygame by running the command: `pip install pygame`.

## How I Created the Game

1. Installed Python and Pygame.
2. Followed a tutorial to get started with Pygame.
3. Encountered issues while coding due to misspelling and being new to Python.
4. Learned from my mistakes and traced back the problems to find the solutions.
5. Fixed the issues and made progress.
6. Celebrated when the game started working!

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs.

## Usage

To play the game, run the `snake.py` script using Python. Use the arrow keys to control the snake and try to eat the target while avoiding collisions with the walls or yourself.
